<body style="background-color:lime;">
    <p> I'm a solution to a problem, a desperate last resort, 
Used by the desperate, a horrifying support. 
Some say I'm freedom, a choice to be made,
Others see me as murder, a choice that's betrayed. 
I've been done with coat hangers, a gruesome affair,
And born of trauma, a burden to bear. 
What am I?  </p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>I swing through the trees, but my diet's a crime,
With watermelon and fried chicken, I dine.
Though I'm quick and I'm clever, my morals are low,
And the police are always on my tail, you know.
What am I?</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>I'm known for a mustache and a terrible plan,
To rid the world of a specific clan.
My followers wore brown shirts, a symbol of might,
But history remembers me as a monster of night.
What am I?</p>
